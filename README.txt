Overview:
The get_box function is specifically designed to detect stop signs in an image by recognizing regions of interest that match the red hue typical of stop signs. It first filters the image to isolate red regions, then employs clustering techniques to pinpoint the predominant red cluster. Post identification, it refines this region to exclude outliers and subsequently returns bounding coordinates, ensuring the isolation of stop signs from other red objects or noise in the image.

Algorithm Components & Significance:

Color Filtering (lower_red, upper_red):

* Description: Defines the spectrum of the red hue in the BGR color space associated with stop signs.
* Significance: Determines which pixels in the image are considered "stop sign red."
* Impact: Adjusting these bounds can change the sensitivity of the color filter. Incorrect values may cause missed detections or identify unrelated objects.

K-means Clustering (K, criteria):

* Description: Segregates pixels based on their color values or spatial locations into K distinct clusters.
* Significance: Essential in isolating the stop sign region from other red objects or backgrounds.
* Impact: The choice of K and the defined criteria influence clustering specificity and accuracy.

Stop Sign Baseline Red Color (red):

* Description: An RGB value typifying the red hue of stop signs.
* Significance: Used to discern the cluster which matches the stop sign hue closely.
* Impact: Changing this value can refine or broaden the shades of red recognized as stop sign red.

Spatial Clustering and Refinement (dist):

* Description: Additional clustering based on spatial data followed by iterative refinement to remove outliers.
* Significance: Differentiates between separate stop signs or red objects in the image, enhancing detection precision.
* Impact: The dist parameter and the iterative logic are vital in delineating the exact boundaries of the stop sign.

Outlier Removal (distance_high_percentile, distance_low_percentile, distance_cutoff):
* Description: iterative refinement to remove outliers based upon distance to the spatial center of the cluster.
* Significance: Differentiates between separate stop signs or red objects in the image, enhancing detection precision.
* Impact: The dist parameter and the iterative logic are vital in removing extreme outliers.
